**Note:** For additional formatting, GitHub Markdown supports basic styling such as:

- **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`
- *Italic*: `*text*` or `_text_`
- `Code`: `` `code` ``
- ~~Strikethrough~~: `~~text~~`
- `Highlighted`: You can use `==text==` (note that GitHub does not support this directly; use HTML for custom styles).

To add more advanced styling such as background colors or specific fonts, you would typically use HTML within the Markdown file, but keep in mind that GitHub's rendering engine may not support all CSS styles directly in Markdown files. For most uses, Markdown's native styling will be sufficient.
